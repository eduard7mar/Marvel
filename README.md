# Marvel Heroes Project

This project is dedicated to Marvel heroes and leverages the Marvel API (https://developer.marvel.com/) to provide information about characters and comics from the Marvel Universe.

## Project Overview
The Marvel Heroes Project allows users to explore Marvel characters. You can load Marvel heroes, select a specific hero, and view detailed information on the right. The project also features two buttons allowing users to visit the Homepage and WIKI on the official Marvel site (https://www.marvel.com/). Note that sometimes the Homepage and WIKI might not provide additional information about the selected heroes.

## Technologies Used
React
React Hooks

## Please, note that:

This project is currently partially completed, with only one page featuring heroes functioning. What's special about this project is that I utilized Class Components, unlike a similar project that was entirely done with Hooks and completed. I did this for educational purposes to understand how the Class-based approach differs from the Hooks approach.
